This application transforms a static resume into a dynamic, interactive portfolio using the Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API. The project showcases a novel approach to resume presentation by giving life to professional experience through personalized images and interactive Q&A.
A core feature is the automatic generation of images for each work experience. Leveraging Gemini's 'gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview', the application interprets the job title and description to produce a unique, narrative-driven portrait of that experience. These images are arranged on a timeline, creating a visual story that goes beyond simple text. This allows viewers to grasp the novel idea of the candidate's capabilities—the skills, environment, and impact—in a single glance, offering a richer understanding than a bullet-point list ever could.
The second key integration uses Gemini's natural language understanding to provide a personalized interview preparation tool. By clicking on a skill and then a specific job, users can generate a unique interview question that connects their skill to the specific context of that experience(WIP). This utility demonstrates Gemini's power to provide contextually relevant and useful insights, making the application both creatively engaging and highly practical.
